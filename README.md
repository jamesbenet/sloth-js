## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have one a good amount of research on the functionality of what I consider to be good e-commerce sites, and the appearance/functionality that I want to mimic is all possible with previous course material. 

### Weaknesses: 

I still have trouble fully comprehending some of the material we've covered so I will want to identify and address any "knowledge gaps" early on as they relate to what I'm trying to do so that as soon as I build the basic structure I can focus on any presumed difficulties in implementation I might have. 

### Opportunities: 

One of the reasons that I chose this project/priduct is that it allows me to catalog the key terms and concepts we've learned over the past 2 weeks. It also allows me to get some experience building a job-ready skill: implementing a responsive e-commerce site. 

### Threats: 

Time management. Time management. Time management. Each day I plan to create a list of do's and dont's (things that went well/bad) so that I can address them in a timely fashion. Some day this list may be created by mid-day!
