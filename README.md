## Project Description

Reaction (AKA Sloth JS, title in progress) mimics an e-commerce/shopping site that sells a unique product: React components, JSX, hooks, props, etc. It is built with React and Airtable. The user will have access to the current catalog of items available, including the ability to view each item's description/definition, reviews and price. User will also be able to contribute their own product suggestions via a form as well as view previous suggestions.

Page body consists of listings for several of the products, and a few buttons for a)bestsellers b)new items c) view all. Form page consist of form and previous form submissions listed below it.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have one a good amount of research on the functionality of what I consider to be good e-commerce sites, and the appearance/functionality that I want to mimic is all possible with previous course material. 

### Weaknesses: 

I still have trouble fully comprehending some of the material we've covered so I will want to identify and address any "knowledge gaps" early on as they relate to what I'm trying to do so that as soon as I build the basic structure I can focus on any presumed difficulties in implementation I might have. 

### Opportunities: 

One of the reasons that I chose this project/priduct is that it allows me to catalog the key terms and concepts we've learned over the past 2 weeks. It also allows me to get some experience building a job-ready skill: implementing a responsive e-commerce site. 

### Threats: 

Time management. Each day I plan to create a list of do's and dont's (things that went well/bad) so that I can address them in a timely fashion. Some days this list may be created by mid-day! (We all reserved the right to start our day over at anytime, right?)
